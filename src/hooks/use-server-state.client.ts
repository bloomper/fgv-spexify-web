 * Local state over a value from the server, for changes shown at once while they are saved: it starts as the value and
 * starts over whenever the server sends a different one. Plain `useState(value)` would keep its first value for as
 * long as the component lives, and with `cacheComponents` Next keeps visited pages alive, so coming back to a page
 * would show what it had before changes made elsewhere. `key` tells values apart (by default `Object.is`), for arrays
 * and objects that arrive as new copies with the same content.
